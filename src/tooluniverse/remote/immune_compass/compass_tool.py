COMPASS Prediction Tool - MCP Server

This module provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for running immune checkpoint
inhibitor (ICI) response predictions using the COMPASS (COMprehensive Pathway Analysis
for Single-cell Sequencing) model. The tool processes tumor gene expression data to
predict patient responsiveness to immunotherapy.

The COMPASS model analyzes gene expression profiles to identify key immune cell
populations and pathways that contribute to treatment response prediction.

    Clinical Context:
